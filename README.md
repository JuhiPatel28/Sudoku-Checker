The program itself takes these puzzles and decides whether the puzzles are
- Solved: there are no no errors or blank spaces in the puzzle
- Valid: there are no errors in the puzzle, but there are blank spaces
- Invalid: the puzzle has one or more errors

The program then outputs the puzzle name and validity. If the puzzle is determined to be invalid, the program will also detect and output the reason why it is invalid.
