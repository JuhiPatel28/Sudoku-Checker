# SudokuChecker

a program that was able to take a document of sudoku puzzles and decide whether the puzzles
presented were valid (there were no errors in the puzzle, but there were blank spaces), solved (the puzzle had no
errors or blank spaces), and invalid (the puzzle had some problems and was not a valid sudoku puzzle). In addition, if
the program decided a puzzle was invalid, it would list the reason why. For example: row 1 has multiple 7s.
